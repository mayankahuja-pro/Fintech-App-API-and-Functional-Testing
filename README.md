# Fintech App API and Functional Testing Project

## Overview
This project is a demonstration of API and functional testing skills developed as part of my application for the Software Quality Analyst (SQA) internship at Josh Technology Group (JTG). It includes manual test cases, API testing using Postman, and a basic functional test of a mock Fintech application. The project aligns with JTG's focus on quality assurance for products spanning web and mobile platforms.

## Project Details
- **Purpose**: To showcase the ability to create test plans, execute tests, identify bugs, and improve product quality.
- **Technologies Used**: Postman (API testing), HTML (basic functional mockup).
- **Date Created**: October 26, 2025

## Features
- **Test Cases**: Manual test scenarios for transaction creation, insufficient balance checks, and transaction history retrieval.
- **API Testing**: Simulated API requests using Postman for a mock Fintech API endpoint.
